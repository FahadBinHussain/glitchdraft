## extension build / reload

no-build MV3, plain js in `extension/` (loaded raw by `extension/manifest.json`).
bump `version` patch in the manifest in the same edit as any extension change.
reload with `pwsh tools/reload-extension.ps1` — it opens `extension/reload.html`,
which messages bg to blank its tab + call `chrome.runtime.reload()`, so manifest
bumps are picked up too. Extensions Reloader (`start msedge
http://reload.extensions`) is JS-only and never re-reads the manifest; the manual
button on `edge://extensions` is fallback.
